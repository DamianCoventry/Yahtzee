The object of Yahtzee is to obtain the highest score from throwing 5
dice.<br>
The game consists of 13 rounds. In each round, you roll the dice and
then score the roll in one of 13 categories. You must score once in
each category. The score is determined by a different rule for each
category.<br>
The game ends once all 13 categories have been scored. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size="+1"><b><u>Game Start</u></b></font> </font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma"> To start with, roll all the dice. After rolling
you can either score the current roll (see below), or re-roll any or
all of the dice. </font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma"> You may only roll the dice a total of 3 times.
After rolling 3 times you must choose a category to score. </font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">You may score the dice at any point in the
round, i.e. it doesn't have to be after the 3rd roll. </font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size="+1"><b><u>Scoring</u></b></font> </font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">To score your combination of 5 dice, you click
one of the 13 boxes, or write it on the scorecard. There are two sections to the score table - the Upper
Section and the Lower Section. </font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Once a box has been scored, it cannot be scored
again for the rest of the game (except the Yahtzee category), so choose
wisely. </font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><b><u>Upper Section Scoring</u></b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">If you score in the upper section of the table,
your score is the total of the specified die face.<br>
So if you roll:<br>
5 - 2 - 5 - 6 - 5 and score in the Fives category, your total for the
category would be 15, because there are three fives, which are added
together.<br>
If the One, Three or Four Categories were selected for scoring with
this roll, you would score a zero.<br>
If placed in the Two or Six category, you would score 2 and 6
respectively. </font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Bonus If the total of Upper scores is 63 or
more, add a bonus of 35. Note that 63 is the total of three each of 1s,
2s, 3s, 4s, 5s and 6s.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><b><u>Lower Section Scoring</u></b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">In the lower scores, you score either a set
amount, or zero if you don't satisfy the category requirements. </font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><b>3 and 4 of a kind</b> For 3 of a kind you
must have at least 3 of the same die faces. You score the total of all
the dice. For 4 of a kind you would need 4 die faces the same. </font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><b>Small and Large Straight</b> A Straight is a
sequence of consecutive die faces, where a small straight is 4
consecutive faces, and a large straight 5 consecutive faces.<br>
Small straights score 30 and a large 40 points.<br>
So if you rolled:<br>
2 - 3 - 2 - 5 - 4<br>
you could score 30 in small straight or 0 in large straight. </font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><b>Full House</b> A Full House is where you have
3 of a kind and 2 of a kind. Full houses score 25 points.<br>
i.e.:<br>
3 - 3 - 2 - 3 - 2<br>
would score 25 in the Full House category.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><b>Yahtzee</b> A Yahtzee is 5 of a kind and
scores 50 points, although you may elect NOT to score it as a yahtzee,
instead choosing to take it as a top row score and safegaurd you bonus.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">If you roll a second Yahtzee in a game, and you
scored your first yahtzee in the Yahtzee box, you would score a further
bonus 100 points in the yahtzee box. You must also put this roll into
another category, as follows;</font></p>
<font face="Tahoma">-If the corresponding Upper section category is not
filled then you must score there.<br>
ie if you rolled 4 - 4 - 4 - 4 - 4 and the Fours Category is not
filled, you&nbsp;must put the score in the Fours category. </font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">-If the corresponding Upper section category is
filled you may then put the score anywhere on the Upper Section
(scoring zero). In 3 of a Kind, 4 of a Kind, and Chance categories you
would score the total of the die faces. For the Small Straight, Large
Straight, and Full House categories, you would score 30, 40 and 25
points respectively. </font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><b>Chance</b> You can roll anything and be able
to put it in the Chance category. You score the total of the die faces.
